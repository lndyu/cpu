# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

- I started by creating an Arithmetic Logic Unit, which takes 2 number inputs and, using a switch input, performs a specific calculation and outputs it. 
- Then, I created a register file which allows a processor to store values in a sort of temporary memory so it can perform calculations quickly.
- I then implemented a method that takes a specific machine code input and performs the necessary calculation on that instruction.
